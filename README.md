# wf2roam

Script for converting [WorkFlowy](https://workflowy.com) JSON into [Roam](https://roamresearch.com) import JSON. You can already easily copy-paste between WorkFlowy & Roam , but this script will preserve edit stamps and turn top-level nodes (or nodes at some other level) into their own pages.

Works as both a node module for use in other projects, as well as a command-line interface. The cli can be used in many diverse ways.

npm install --save wf2roam
```

## As command-line script

### Install as a command-line tool

```bash
npm install --global wf2roam
```

### Use it

The simplest way to use it
